     #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

 template <class R> 
 void swap_value(R &a, R &b) //pass by reference to actually change the value not just to change their local copy

    // storing the value of a temporaray so that we have empty a to set value of b in it 
     R temp = a ;   
     //  putting all values of b into a as we make a empty for that purpse ðŸ˜’
     a = b ;
     // Now assigning the value that is stored in temporary location to  b or u can say b = a 
     b = temp ; 

 }

     // Original value
